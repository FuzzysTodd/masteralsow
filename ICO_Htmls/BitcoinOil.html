       Decentralized governance remains a huge issue and one of the main problems for Bitcoin in the future. When 95% supermajority of miners is required for the approval of change and only a few core developers could decide about Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP) review and innovation, many years pass without innovation or improvements. Therefore, Bitcoin Oil has decided to end this innovation backlog by centralizing change. We believe "it takes a revolution to make a solution", and important improvements can only be accomplished in a timely manner as a result of a concerted action, which is why Bitcoin Oil has organized itself as company and has chosen the means of a hard fork to accomplish the wide range of innovations identified in our SSPSS strategy. It would probably take forever to get something as complex as our SSPSS innovations done in this long-winded BIP structure. Imagine what Bitcoin Oil's highly talented team of developers could accomplish in a few months or half a year, as after the ICO our team will have access to more developers than Bitcoin and our developers will be encouraged to fast-track all key developments without this lengthy BIP formalities. Hence, we will take several of Bitcoin's most promising pending BIPs and add several more of our own BIPs and create an unparalleled wave of innovations in such a short time, that the world will be able to choose between two versions of Bitcoin, one of which is still looking at a whole range of pending innovations and one of which will have already incorporated all of these (and many more) improvements.

       Our solution will resolve Bitcoinâs innovation backlog and create a truly groundbreaking Bitcoin based blockchain technology. In this sense, it is very important to understand that Bitcoin Oil â unlike Bitcoin â will not have to follow the lengthy and protracted BIP procedures which make rapid change almost impossible. Contrary to that inhibitor of innovation, Bitcoin Oil has straight forward agreements in place with some of the largest blockchain and Bitcoin development companies in the world, which will be commissioned by us to build Bitcoin's 2019 BTCO fork and all subsequent improvements thereof.

        One day, all people on this planet (and beyond) will have the opportunity to use cryptocurrencies, realizing the full potential of decentralization in general and Bitcoin in particular, to drive a new era of economic change, growth, productivity, and prosperity. Therefore, Bitcoin Oil's mission is to create a better future for all by utilizing the unparalleled benefits of cryptocurrency and the amazing opportunities of an improved version of Bitcoin. In order to accomplish such a complex process of change, a certain amount of temporary centralization will be required, which is why Bitcoin Oil develops its highly innovative BTCO hard fork. As key element of this strategy Bitcoin Oil focusses on its intention to "go green" by utilizing the Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol to solve Bitcoin's serious energy consumption problems and related issues. We have an opportunity as Bitcoin Oil to mitigate, for the first time, a significant concern that cryptocurrency users have regarding a large amount of electric energy consumed by Bitcoin miners.

      The implementation of the BTCO hard fork will create the technologically most advanced version of Bitcoin. The centerpiece of BTCO and its "Optimally Improved Ledger" (OIL) will be the highly innovative "SSPSS" strategy (Stability â Sustainability â Privacy â Smart Sidechains â Scalability) focusing on the development of superior Bitcoin improvements. All innovations will be implemented by world-leading developers, creating huge opportunities and enormous potential for all BTCO participants and the entire Bitcoin community.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Our forthcoming 2019 hard fork has many advantages and will implement a whole range of long overdue Bitcoin improvements based on our âOptimally Improved Ledgerâ (OIL) technology.

      Fortunately, Bitcoin Oil will not have to follow the lengthy and protracted BIP procedures which make rapid change almost impossible. As outlined before, Bitcoin Oil has straight forward agreements in place with some of the largest blockchain and Bitcoin development companies in the world, which will be commissioned by us to build Bitcoin's 2019 BTCO fork and all subsequent improvements thereof. So, Bitcoin Oil is in the process of implementing a threefold development approach by integrating in-house development teams, outsourced individual developers, and large blockchain development companies, thereby enabling Bitcoin Oil to ensure the availability at all times the resources required for its continued technical implementation process. Therefore, Bitcoin Oil recently announced details of its plan to partner with top-rated blockchain development companies to roll out its strategic plan and roadmap, including the forthcoming Proof-of-Stake ("PoS") based Bitcoin hard fork. Ahead of this hotly anticipated milestone, Bitcoin Oil has already launched a hiring campaign with several new job postings being published on the internet for its internal team of developers. At the same time, Bitcoin Oil built partnerships with more than a handful of well-known blockchain development companies in different countries to become development partners for Bitcoin Oil's technical blockchain developments providing a workforce of several hundred developers.

         Interested participants should refer to Bitcoin Oil's forthcoming White Paper and technical Yellow Paper for detailed information and for a comprehensive understanding of the potential risks as well as benefits and technical properties associated with Bitcoin Oil, of which a summary is contained herein. Bitcoin Oil is still at a very early stage of development. The company may have to make changes to the specifications of Bitcoin Oil for any number of legitimate reasons or may be unable to develop Bitcoin Oil in a way that realizes those specifications or any form of a functioning network. To the extent that Bitcoin Oil is successfully developed and the Bitcoin Oil hard fork is completed, Bitcoin Oil may not meet participants' expectations and may be different from those set out on this website. Furthermore, despite Bitcoin Oil's efforts to develop and complete the Bitcoin Oil hard fork and subsequently to develop and maintain Bitcoin Oil, it is still possible that Bitcoin Oil will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact Bitcoin Oil. The development of Bitcoin Oil will require significant capital, expertise, time and effort. Bitcoin Oil may require substantially more funding or time in development than currently expected, which may result in suspension or cancellation of development of Bitcoin Oil. If Bitcoin Oil is not successful in its efforts to demonstrate to users the utility and value of Bitcoin Oil, there may not be any sufficient demand for Bitcoin Oil to proceed with the development of the Bitcoin Oil hard fork. As a result, or if the development of the Bitcoin Oil hard fork does not occur, participants may lose all of the funds provided in connection with the Bitcoin Oil sale. Due to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin Oil, there is no guarantee that the Bitcoin Oil hard fork (to the extent that it is developed) will be deployed as intended or at all. Bitcoin Oil might not come into existence, whether as part of the Bitcoin Oil hard fork or otherwise, if there is no deployment of the Bitcoin Oil hard fork. Bitcoin Oil may not have or may not be able to obtain the technical skills and expertise needed to successfully develop Bitcoin Oil and progress it to develop the Bitcoin Oil hard fork. There is a general scarcity of management, technical, scientific, research and marketing personnel with appropriate training to develop and maintain Bitcoin Oil.

This website contains information about pending transactions, and there can be no assurance that any of these transactions will be completed in accordance with the terms described in this website or at all.

Even though Bitcoin Oil intends to deliver and distribute certain initial Bitcoin Oil to the record holders of Bitcoin then existing on the Bitcoin network, such delivery and distribution may be restricted or prohibited by laws of the jurisdiction in which such holders reside or such distribution or delivery may result in Bitcoin Oil being required to register such Bitcoin Oil under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the securities law of any other applicable jurisdiction. Bitcoin Oil is in the process of assessing regulatory requirements for the delivery and distribution of such initial Bitcoin Oil to the then holders of Bitcoin and there can be no assurance whether Bitcoin Oil would be able to make such delivery or distribution to any such holder. This website contains statements that are forward-looking (such as when Bitcoin Oil describes what it "plans," "believes," "intends," "seeks," "aims," or "anticipates" will occur, what "will," "potentially," or "could" happen, and other similar statements or the negative of such terms or statements), which may not be correct, even though Bitcoin Oil believes that they are reasonable at the time of this website. Bitcoin Oil does not guarantee that such forward-looking statements will happen as described or that they will happen at all. Further information regarding risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement is included in the forthcoming White Paper. Bitcoin Oil undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made.
