        What is MEDIS?
       </h2>
       <p class="lead">
        A blockchain-supported system aiming to enhance methods of storage, access and use of electronic health records.
        <br/>
        MEDIS is a new approach that aspires to give control to patients over their existing medical records and health related data, while making it instantly available everywhere. The system utilizes distributed storage technology for redundancy and availability, distributed computing for access control and auditing, and strong cryptographic encryption to ensure confidentiality of the content uploaded in the form of medical records, diagnostic imaging and related information.

       <p class="small">
        * All medical records are anonymized according to HIPAA requirements prior to being made available for review or download by other entities.

       <p>
        mymedis.in and its mother company MYMEDIS.IN, LLC. respects the privacy of visitors to its web sites and services. As a result, we have developed this privacy policy. This privacy policy applies only to the operation of services and web sites operated by mymedis.in that directly link to this policy when you click on "privacy statement" in the website footer.

       <strong>
        Log information
       </strong>
       <p>
        When you use our services or view content provided by ryansguardianangels.com, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include: Internet protocol address, time and date of your picture message or email, telephony log information like your phone number or email address, device information such as hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request.
       </p>
       <strong>
        Location information
       </strong>
       <p>
        When you use the mymedis.in service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS coordinates recorded and embedded by your mobile device into the image you submit (EXIF information). We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as IP address (Internet Protocol) geo-location and browser based geo-location.
       </p>
       <strong>
        Cookies and anonymous identifiers
       </strong>
       <p>
        We use various technologies to collect and store information when you interact with a mymedis.inservice, and this may include sending one or more anonymous identifiers to your device. When you visit one of the mymedis.inoperated websites, we may also use cookies (see below). This website may use a technology called a "cookie". A cookie is a piece of information that our webserver sends to your computer (actually to your browser file) when you access a website. Then when you come back our site will detect whether you have one of our cookies on your computer. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the site and help us analyze site usage more accurately. For instance, our site may set a cookie on your browser that keeps you from needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the site. This website uses Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet. Generally, an IP address changes each time you connect to the Internet (it is a "dynamic" address). Note, however, that if you have a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance, it is possible that your IP Address that we collect, or even perhaps a cookie we use, may contain information that could be deemed identifiable. This is because with some broadband connections your IP Address doesn't change (it is "static") and could be associated with your personal computer. We use your IP address to report aggregate information on use and to help improve the website.
       </p>
       <strong>
        How we use information we collect
       </strong>
       <p>
        You should be aware that this site is not intended for, or designed to attract, individuals under the age of 18. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is an individual under the age of 18. Some areas of this website that collect Your Information use industry standard secure socket layer encryption (SSL); however, to take advantage of this your browser must support encryption protection (found in Internet Explorer release 3.0 and above). We may share Your Information with third parties in connection with services that these individuals or entities perform for. These agents, contractors or partners are restricted from using this data in any way other than to provide services for contractual partners, or services for the collaboration in which they and their partners are engaged (for example, some of our products are developed and marketed through joint agreements with other companies). mymedis.in LIMITED reserves the right to share Your Information to respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental authorities or where required by law. In exceptionally rare circumstances where national, state or company security is at issue (such as with the World Trade Center terrorist act in September, 2001), mymedis.in LIMITED reserves the right to share our entire database of visitors and customers with appropriate governmental authorities. The policies and procedures described in this privacy policy do not apply to external websites linked to from this website but not owned or operated by mymedis.in LIMITED We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection, and distribution policies. We may update this Web site Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do update it, for your convenience, we will make the updated policy available on this page.
