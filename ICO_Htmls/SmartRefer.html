   SmartRefer: The First-Ever Blockchain Referral and Recruiting Marketplace
  </h1>
  <p>
   Happy holidays to our dear clients! Smart Refer Team welcomes you at our Medium page. We've decided to take a fresh start this year and develop our team's openness by updating Medium and posting new articles every week.
  </p>
  <p>
   In SmartRefer, we hold the view that a person is best known by familiars, relatives, and comrades. And, perhaps, Google.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reliance on your personal connections while searching for fresh employment choices allows you to find more suitable positions in the best companies available.
  </p>
  <p>
   SmartRefer provides a marketplace-type service, targeted at people on the platform referring each other. Its aim is to use modern technologies, such as machine learning and blockchain, to assist candidates in finding open jobs in IT-related industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through SmartRefer, any individual is capable of recommending a friend for a position in a certain company. Users whose suggested friends were employed by organizations would later receive rewards in the form of a currency named Fiat combined with special ERC-223 REFER Membership tokens. The above benefits are later to be exchanged on our “SmartMarket” for certificates, vouchers, successful employment suggestions, CV filling tips, and job skill upgrades or, upon your choice, for goods and services offered by other organizations through the SmartRefer website.
  </p>
  <p>
   SmartRefer is capable of beating all current sources of locating and hiring talents in IT-related fields.

   Our Initial Public Offering
  </h2>
  <p>
   On the 25th of January 2018, we are about to launch an initial public sale of our currency. It is aimed at offering our foremost clients the most profitable ERC-223 REFER Memberships. They are built on the Ethereum platform, and they represent completely upgradable hybrid ERC 20/223 token standards. Moreover, SmartRefer aims at assisting engineers inexperienced in Solidity in increasing their skills through developing a never before encountered, open, and all-embracing ERC-223 library.
